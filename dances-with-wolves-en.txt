In this session, we will view scenes from the excellent film Dances with Wolves (starring Kevin Costner and Mary McDonnell) and explore the illusion of separation that convinces so many of us of the need to struggle and compete in a so-called “dog-eat-dog” world in which there seemingly aren’t enough resources for everyone. We will then see how we can dispel that illusion and thereby eliminate the barriers that prevent us from uniting with others and experiencing life’s magic. We will also discuss how we can develop a profound trust in our divine source to provide all that we need, knowing that we are never separated from it or any of the items and elements necessary for living an enchanted life. 


Note: Please try to watch the film before attending the event, but don´t worry if you can´t. We will view scenes from the movie, either in Spanish or with Spanish subtitles. Please RSVP only if you are sure you can come. If you are deciding at the last minute, just come. Thank you!
